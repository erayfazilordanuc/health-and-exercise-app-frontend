## Why this project?
Most fitness apps focus on healthy athletes and overlook patients who need **low-impact rehab routines** and **close, professional oversight**.  
This app closes that gap by providing:

* **Weekly rehab calendar** ‚Äì a ready-made _Mon / Wed / Fri_ exercise schedule patients can check off as they go.  
* **Live vitals sync** ‚Äì automatic import of steps, heart-rate and sleep via **Health Connect / HealthKit**.  
* **Manual symptom logging** ‚Äì patients can quickly record pain, fatigue or other symptoms whenever they occur.  
* **In-app nurse chat** ‚Äì secure messaging keeps patients motivated and lets nurses respond in real time.  
* **Role-based dashboards** ‚Äì admins add or edit exercises and monitor each patient‚Äôs progress at a glance.

patients follow doctor-approved rehab routines while giving healthcare
staff full visibility into recovery.

### Patient Module
- **Live self-tracking** of steps, heart-rate and sleep via **Health Connect / HealthKit**. Users can add their additional symptoms manually whenever needed
- **Weekly exercise calendar** shows the non-customised programme (e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri) and marks completed sessions.  
- **Group nurse chat** lets patients talk directly with assigned nurses for motivation and quick feedback.

### Admin Module
- **Exercise manager** to add, edit or retire workouts in the catalogue.  
- **Real-time patient symptoms dashboard** that lists each patient‚Äôs adherence and latest vitals inside the admin‚Äôs group.  
- **Messaging with patient** so nurses can guide patients and track progress without leaving the app.
