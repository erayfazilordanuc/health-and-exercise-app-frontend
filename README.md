## Why this project?
Traditional exercise apps rarely cater to patients who need **doctor-prescribed, low-impact routines** and **fine-grained progress monitoring**.  
This project bridges that gap by offering:

* **Prescription-level scheduling** (e.g. _Mon / Wed / Fri_ workouts with adjustable intensity).
* **Seamless Health Connect sync** for vitals & activity data.
* **Role-based dashboards** for patients, physiotherapists, and admins.
